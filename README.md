Here's a section you can add to your `README.md` file for your real-time chat application:

# Real-Time Chat App with MERN Stack

This is a real-time chat application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with JWT authentication and Socket.IO for real-time communication.

## Setup Environment Variables

Before running the application, set up your `.env` file with the following variables:

```env
PORT=6000
MONGO_DB_URI=mongodb+srv://manoj:JQRsziPAIFFPDNel@cluster0.ggyew.mongodb.net/my-chat-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
JWT_SECRET=mySecretKey12345
NODE_ENV=development_or_production
```

- **PORT:** The port number on which the server will run (e.g., 5000).
- **MONGO_DB_URI:** Ymongodb+srv://manoj:JQRsziPAIFFPDNel@cluster0.ggyew.mongodb.net/my-chat-app?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
- **JWT_SECRET:** mySecretKey12345.
- **NODE_ENV:** Set to `development` during development and `production` when deploying.

## Building the Application

1. **Install Dependencies**  
   Ensure Node.js and npm are installed. Run the following command to install necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**  
   Start the server by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:6000`.

3. **Frontend Setup**  
   The frontend is built using React. Ensure the frontend is connected to the backend for authentication and chat features.

## Features

- **Real-Time Messaging:** Utilizes Socket.IO for real-time communication.
- **Authentication:** Secure JWT-based authentication for users.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Stores user data and chat history.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, ensure your `.env` variables are correctly set on the hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel).
